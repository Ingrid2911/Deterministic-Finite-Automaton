# ðŸ¤– Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) from Regular Expression

This C++ project focuses on building and transforming finite automaton from regular expressions. The application allows users to input a regular expression which is first converted into a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA), including Î»-transitions (epsilon transitions), and then transformed into a deterministic finite automaton (DFA).

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- C++
- Formal languages and automata theory
- DFA / NFA logic
- Lambda transitions

## ðŸš€ Features
- Parse and interpret regular expressions
- Build a lambda-NFA
- Convert lambda-NFA into an equivalent DFA
- Display the automaton structure

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Modeling regular expressions as finite automata
- Accurate NFA â†’ DFA conversion
- Implementing and handling lambda-transitions
